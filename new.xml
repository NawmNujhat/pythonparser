  Dear Daniel,
 </salutation>
 <text>
  Thank you f or sending us the information on
  
   SDL Trados Studio 2009
  
  .

    We like your products and think they certainly represent the most powerful translation solution on the market.

    We especially like the
  
   XML Parser rules
  
  options in the
  
   XML
  
  filter.

    It has helped us to set up support for our XML files in a flash.

    We have already downloaded the latest version from your Customer Center.
